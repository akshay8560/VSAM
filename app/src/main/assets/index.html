                “us”) is to provide a social network where the user is the center of the
                network, not an advertiser or some entity looking to follow and track you.
                Vsam is a Passionate social networking platform where you can connect with
                other people, can participate in challenges and build your community without
                worrying about us tracking your behavior for advertisers or selling your
                content. This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) includes the terms by
                which you may access and use that social network and the online and/or
                mobile services, website, and/or software provided on or in connection with
                that social network (collectively, the “Service”).
                Because the law is technical and we need to protect our users (including you) and ourselves so that
                everyone has a great experience with the Service, the Agreement is set out in the “Legal Terms of
                Use” section below. However, we believe in transparency for our users.
                If you have any questions about this Agreement, please see the “Legal” section of our Support &
                FAQs page or contact us at any time at support@vsam.me .

                YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION CONTAINED HEREIN. This AGREEMENT applies to all
                visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”). THIS IS A CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND
                Vsam. By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
